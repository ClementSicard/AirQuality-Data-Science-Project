# Model pipeline :

1. [ ] Load datasets, clean and merge them
2. [ ] Compute statistics on them (correlation, similarities, DTW)
3. [ ] Impute missing values using multiple techniques (EMA, ARIMA, ...), and choose the one with the least error
4. [ ] Normalize imputed dataset
5. [ ] Feed it to the LSTM model
